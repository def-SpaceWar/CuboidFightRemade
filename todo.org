#+TITLE: TODO

* TODO Make new class called 'Zombie'
base stats are Berserk but worse
+ HP is 100
- slower
- no ground pound
+ decent jump (2x)
- low reload speed
- low damage
+ after it dies it stays alive for 10 more seconds and has damageBoost(10, 10) and speedBoost(10, 4) which is very OP
+ while its a "zombie" give a accessory that goes on top that only shows when its hp is 0 that is just a moldy green with
  the players colored eye sockets.
+ killBuff is to buff its overall stats by 5% in EVERYTHING (including health).
+ special is to kill anyone <=10 hp and make its HP 10 so another zombie could theoretically kill another zombie that just used its special.
+ for every person the zombie kills (in special), it gets a LOT OF killingMachine and bloodLust.
* TODO Description for every single class on ~~a new page~~ the main screen that you can scroll through!
* TODO Juggernaut class will have meteor rain special.
* TODO Each class should have it's own aesthetic change like the vampire having wings. [1/2]
The vampire's wings will be of 2 different images and there will be a class for it that can draw. The player class will get an array called `cosmetics` and it will have the 2 vampire wings if it is a vampire and they're rotation will change based on the value of the jump force and their angles will be the inverse of eachother creating a flying effect when the vampire jumps. The wings will also be rendered under the player.
+ [X] Vampire Wings
+ [ ] Ninja Bandana that changes direction depending on movement

* Dead...
* KILL Using multiplayer firebase tutorial make single player button that plays ONLINE!
* KILL Red platforms with gray bottom color that does damage every half a second you stand on it and slows you! (introduced in the communist map)
The top part will FLASH from white to red every half a second to indicate when it will do damage.
Some platforms will do more damage than others and will have longer cooldowns till damage.
* KILL Each side of the map should have different death messages other than the one from the bottom.
* KILL Add survival gamemode where everyone is team and a buncha gray squares spawn and try to kill them.
Basically a survival single/multiplayer mode.
