#+TITLE: TODO

* TODO Juggernaut gamemode where everyone has LIVES and tries to kill the juggernaut, teams will be blatantly reset for all the players.
  The juggernaut will be bigger and have more damage, health, kbDef, basically everything.
  Slower too!
* TODO Description for every single class on a new page.
* TODO Red platforms with gray bottom color that does damage every half a second you stand on it and slows you! (introduced in the communist map)
* TODO Each side of the map should have different death messages other than the one from the bottom.
* TODO Make a communist map. (Rithvik gets the honors of bg image. 256 x 128 px just like last time.)
* TODO Add survival gamemode where everyone is team and a buncha gray squares spawn and try to kill them.
Basically a survival single/multiplayer mode.
* TODO Each class should have it's own aesthetic change like the vampire having wings. [1/2]
The vampire's wings will be of 2 different images and there will be a class for it that can draw. The player class will get an array called `cosmetics` and it will have the 2 vampire wings if it is a vampire and they're rotation will change based on the value of the jump force and their angles will be the inverse of eachother creating a flying effect when the vampire jumps. The wings will also be rendered under the player.
+ [X] Vampire Wings
+ [ ] Ninja Bandana that changes direction depending on movement
* TODO Style the entire website.
Add a navbar that can send you to the settings page and back to the game. And also add instructions!
